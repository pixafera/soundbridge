## About <a name="about"></a>

This is a library for interacting with [Roku Soundbridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoundBridge), a network music
player that Roku made before they were known for set-top boxes.  Soundbridges can be controlled over the network with
a text based protocol called RCP.  This library implements an RCP client for the .net platform.

You'll need:

* Visual Studio 2022 Express with the following options:
  * .net desktop development
